# SOLID-Principles

SOLID Principles is a coding standard that all developers should have a clear
concept for developing software in a proper way to avoid a bad design.
It was promoted by Robert C Martin and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum.
When applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read.

When the developer builds a software follow the bad design, the code can become
inflexible and more brittle, small changes in the software can result in bugs.
For these reasons, we should follow SOLID Principles.

It takes some time to understand, but if you write code following the principles
it will improve code quality and will help to understand the most well-designed software.

To understand SOLID principles, you have to know the use of the interface clearly.
If your concept is not clear about interface then you can read this [doc](https://medium.com/@ankitgg66/being-solid-in-dart-1933037168ae).

I'm going to try to explain SOLID Principles in simplest way so that it's easy
for beginners to understand. Let's go through each principle one by one:
